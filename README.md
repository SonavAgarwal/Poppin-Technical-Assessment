# Poppin Technical Assessment

## Run Locally

```bash
  cd party-search
  npm install
  npm run dev
```

## Notes

- search implemented locally with minisearch, would be implemented differently with a server
- search code in App.js for simplicity's sake
- added an id to party object (needed for keys etc)
